# Giftastic

Giftastic is a simple application making use of the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/) to display gifs to users and allow users to pick which gifs they want to save as their favorites.  The app uses an AJAX call to get a json response from the giphy api and then displays each gif recieved back on the page.  The gifs can toggle their animation by clicking on them or saved to a favorites section by double clicking on them.  Users can also create their own buttons to search for different gifs.
